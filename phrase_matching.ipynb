These policies are commonly associated with and characterized as supply-side economics, trickle-down economics, or \"voodoo economics\" by opponents,[5] while Reagan and his advocates preferred to call it free-market economics.\n",

    "The results of Reaganomics are still debated. Supporters point to the end of stagflation, stronger GDP growth, and an entrepreneurial revolution in the decades that followed.[7][8] Critics point to the widening income gap, what they described as an atmosphere of greed, reduced economic mobility, and the national debt tripling in eight years which ultimately reversed the post-World War II trend of a shrinking national debt as percentage of GDP\"\"\")"
